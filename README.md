A simple visual appointment schedule view control for WPF.

Inspired by [Oscar de los Santos' WPF Scheduler Control](http://www.oscardelossantos.es/en/developing/wpf-en-developing/wpf-scheduler-control-2/), but after I found a null reference exception that I couldn't fix, I decided to roll my own.

## Features

- Day, Week and Month view
- Not much else

## Todo

- Currently does not check for overlapping appointments, because that was not a requirement in the project that I built this for. Will fix soon.
